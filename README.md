# Classified Ads
At work I maintain a simple classifieds page in HTML.  This requires hand-writing every entry, resizing photos, etc.  I am seeking to automate the process a bit, and hopefully shift the responsibility to someone else once the technical work is no longer required.
I will make this with PHP and MySql.  I haven't written anything in either for a while, and I am eager to hone my skills and get comfortable with more modern, object oriented PHP code.
The initial goal is to create a display page for the ads and basic admin console with a form and some controls for editing and deleting ads.
Long term goals are to add picture resizing, and perhaps authentication for the admin user.  Since this is an internal app for a mostly non-technical audience I am comfortable with security by obscurity for now.
